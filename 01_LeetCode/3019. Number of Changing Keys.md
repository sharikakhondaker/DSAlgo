# [3019. Number of Changing Keys](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-changing-keys/)

## Description
<p> 
You are given a <strong> 0-indexed </strong> string <code>s</code> typed by a user. Changing a key is defined as using a key different from the last used key. For example, <code>s = "ab"</code> has a change of a key while <code>s = "bBBb"</code> does not have any.</p>

<p> Return <em> the number of times the user had to change the key.</em></p>

<p> <strong>Note:</strong> Modifiers like <code>shift</code> or <code>caps</code> lock won't be counted in changing the key that is if a user typed the letter <code>'a'</code> and then the letter <code>'A'</code> then it will not be considered as a changing of key.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = "aAbBcC"
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong> From s[0] = 'a' to s[1] = 'A', there is no change of key as caps lock or shift is not counted.
From s[1] = 'A' to s[2] = 'b', there is a change of key.
From s[2] = 'b' to s[3] = 'B', there is no change of key as caps lock or shift is not counted.
From s[3] = 'B' to s[4] = 'c', there is a change of key.
From s[4] = 'c' to s[5] = 'C', there is no change of key as caps lock or shift is not counted.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>

<pre>
<strong>Input:</strong> s = "AaAaAaaA"
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There is no change of key since only the letters 'a' and 'A' are pressed which does not require change of key.
</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li><code>1 &lt;= s.length &lt;= 100</code></li>
	<li><code>s</code> consists of only upper case and lower case English letters.</li>
</ul>

## Solutions
Because the string only consists of alphabetical characters, and upper and lowercase characters are treated the same, we want to first make all characters lowercase or uppercase. Then we go through each character one by one and compare it to the next character. 

This solution runs in $O(n)$ time, as there is only 1 pass done through the entire length of the string. 

### Solution 1: String Manipulation

```python 
class Solution:
    def countKeyChanges(self, s: str) -> int:
        count = 0 
        s = s.lower()        

        for i in range(len(s) - 1):
            if s[i] != s[i+1]:
                count = count + 1

        return count
```

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    int countKeyChanges(string s) {
        int count = 0; 
        for (int i = 0; i < s.size() - 1; i++){
            if (tolower(s[i]) != tolower(s[i+1])){
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count; 
    }
};
```

``` java 
class Solution {
    public int countKeyChanges(String s) {
        int count = 0;
        s = s.toLowerCase(); 

        for(int i = 0; i < s.length() - 1; i++){
            if(s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(i + 1)){
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
